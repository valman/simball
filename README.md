# simball
A (very simple) basketball game simulator based on team statistics

## Why
I started studying python in 2025 and this project is an exercise for me to use new knowledge while having fun.

## What
The simulator run plays for a team's possession. Each possession can have several plays:
- 2FG attempt
- 3FG attempt
- Pass
- Turnover

## How
The simulator gets data from a CSV file with actual team stats from real teams

## You
Contributions are welcome. If you could help me out in improving the project, please use the forks, Luke, and do a pull request.
